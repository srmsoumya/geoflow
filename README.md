# GeoFLOW - Create effective GeoSpatial workflows using Python, Jupyter Notebooks & Papermill

GeoSpatial Data Analysis is more visual than just numbers. As a Data Scientist, you would prefer to look at the intermediary steps in the processing pipeline. This has a two fold impact:
- Better understanding of your data
- Eases the bug tracking process

To run the notebooks, download [GPW v4 Population Count data](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) & put it inside `data/inter/` folder.
